##### *An inclusive User Experience designer who bring together design, science, and tech to create human-centered solutions.*

## SUMMARY
I'm a multidisciplinary UX designer with a growth mindset, who values diversity and users' voices. My passion for UX design was affirmed after completing an apprenticeship at BRIDGEGOOD, where I synthesized my science and management training towards user-centered designs. I worked with a few clients to create logos and brand identity while studying graphic design at Diablo Valley College.
As a born problem-solver, my goal is to bring my design expertise and pharmacy background to improve users' experience in the healthcare industry.
